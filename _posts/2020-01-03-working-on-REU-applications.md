“I went to college to be a writer and I will leave it aspiring to be a math professor.” 
*Cue rest of essay talking about how I’m an atypical math student & my struggles...*

<!--more-->

I worked on applications for summer research today, which are extremely hard for me because I’ve dealt with so much failure in the past 1.5 yrs including taking a class (multivariable calc) **four times** and almost taking a semester off from school. I had to go through a lot of self doubt and soul searching in order to declare my math major. 

I sob every time I have to do these applications about my experiences with math. It feels like I'm dredging up all my pain and loneliness from that horrible time in my life. I had to do this recently, as I applied for extended funding from my scholarship program for my 5th year in order to finish my math major.

I'll write another blog post about my math struggles in a few months.
