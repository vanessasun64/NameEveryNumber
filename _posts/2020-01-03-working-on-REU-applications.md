“I went to college to be a writer and I will leave it aspiring to be a math professor” 
*cue rest of essay talking about how I’m an atypical math student & my struggles...*

<!--more-->

I worked on applications for summer research today, which are extremely hard for me because I’ve dealt with so much failure in the past 1.5 yrs including taking a class (multivariable calc) four times and almost taking a semester off from school. I sob every time I have to do this. It feels like I'm dredging up all my pain and loneliness from that horrible time in my life. I'll write another blog post about my math struggles in a few months.
